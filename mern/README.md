# Usage
You're gonna want to open up two terminals. One in '../mern/server' and the other in '../mern/campusdate'.
In the '../mern/server' run 
```bash 
node server.js
```
Your terminal should say 
```bash
Server is running on port: 5000
Successfully connected to MongoDB
```

In the '../mern/campusdate' run 
```bash
npm start
```
This should open up a new window with the app/js running.
