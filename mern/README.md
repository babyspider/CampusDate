# Usage
You're gonna want to open up two terminals. One in '../mern/server' and the other in '../mern/campusdate':
In the '../mern/server' run 'node server.js'
Your terminal should say 
"Server is running on port: 5000
Successfully connected to MongoDB."

In the '../mern/campusdate' run 'npm start'
This should open up a new window with the app/js running.
